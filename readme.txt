MUD Game Programming
(C) 2003 Ron Penton


All of the demos in this book can be compiled by following these procedures:
VC6: open up the .dsw file, and hit compile
VC7: open up the .sln file, and hit compile
GCC: type "make"


This is Demo 8.1, a the baseline of SimpleMUD.
This demo only defines items and players, so it isn't very complex, and amounts to nothing
more than a complicated chat program.
